   The aim of this article is to highlight and explain some of the Hubble Telescope’s most notable discoveries.
   It has contributed in pinning down the age of the universe by observing old, burnt-out stars in the globular 
   star cluster (Hubble uncovers oldest "clocks" in space to read age of universe 2002). 
   It has also discovered that at the centre of every major galaxy is a black hole(Finding supermassive black holes - hubble). 
   It has helped narrow down the rate of expansion of the universe by observing stars in faraway galaxies. 
   (Measuring the universe's expansion rate - Hubblesite.org). The Hubble helped in the creation of the 3-d map of dark matter.

  The Hubble Telescope was launched in 1990 after 20 years of planning(What has the Hubble Space Telescope discovered?). 
  It has been named after Edwin Hubble who was an American astronomer and was a major part of the scientific community and 
  gave us the Hubble constant. The Hubble Telescope has been a great tool and contributor to the scientific community as well by 
  helping us uncover new and old mysteries of the universe and by helping us find answers and new theories. This paper talks about 5 of 
  the major discoveries of the Hubble telescope.

  Known to be 13.8 billion years. Hubble has observed and found some of the oldest stars in our galaxy, The Milky Way (see fig 1). 
  These stars provided us with the age of the universe without us having to be dependant of the expansion of the universe measurements. 
  These very dim stars are around 12-13 billion years old. The discovery of these stars has allowed astronomers to calculate the age of the 
  universe as earlier Hubble had showed that the earliest stars were formed less than a billion years after the Big Bang. 
  This research was done by Harvey Richer of the University of British Columbia, Canada and his colleagues(Hubble uncovers oldest "clocks" in space to read age of universe 2002)
  Fig1: shows the oldest stars observed (Hubble uncovers oldest "clocks" in space to read age of universe 2002)

  The rate of expansion of the universe was off by a factor of two when the Hubble telescope was first launched. 
  Therefore, the universe could’ve been 19.7 billion years old or 9.7 billion years old. However, if the universe was 9.7 billion years old it would mean that the universe was younger 
  than the oldest stars that we knew of. Very early observations by the telescope looked for Cephid Variable stars in faraway galaxies for example M100 which is located 56 million light years away (see fig 2). 
  This data let us rectify the estimation of the rate of expansion of the universe. Through observation of more Cephid Variables astronomers were able to refine the value of Hubble’s constant to a 10% error by late 1990’s. 
  Astronomers continued to do this with Cephids at a great distance which led the percentage uncertainty from 10% to 2% in 2019(see fig 3)(Measuring the universe's expansion rate - Hubblesite.org)

  The Hubble telescope was used by astronomers to observe active and inactive galaxies to measure the speed at which the stars and gases in a galaxy spin around a black hole. 
  The observations showed that most if not all galaxies had a supermassive black hole at their core (Finding supermassive black holes - hubble)

  Most of the universe’s mass in accounted for by dark matter however, dark matter does not interact with light and is therefore invisible. 
  Astronomers found its location using gravitational lensing. They analysed positions of 42 galaxies of 135 images that had been lensed. 
  They saw that the light from the galaxies behind Abell 1689, a giant galaxy cluster was distorted as it was interfering matter inside the cluster. 
  This helped the astronomers figure out the location along with the mass of the dark matter present. They then laid over a map of the concentration of dark matter which has been coloured blue (see figure 7) (Hubble's dark matter map - NASA science 2010)

<h3 id=”Conclusion”>Conclusion</h3>    
<p class="ex1">
<pre>
  This article looked at some of the major contributions of the Hubble telescope. The Hubble Telescope has helped create maps of dark matter, found out that at the centre of each galaxy there resides a supermassive black hole, help narrow down the estimate of the rate of expansion of the universe and even helped with finding the age of the universe. 
  Hubble has numerous notable contributions in the field of space sciences and astronomy and will continue to do so as it has time and time again proved its importance.
